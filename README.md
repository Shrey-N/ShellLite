# ShellLite

**ShellLite** is a modern, English-like interpreted programming language designed for simplicity and readability.

## Features

- **Built-in Testing**: Comes with a robust test suite in `tests/`.

## Usage

```bash
python -m src.main examples/hello.sh
```

## Example

to greet name
    say "Hello, " + name

greet "World"
```
