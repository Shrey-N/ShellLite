# Introduction to ShellLite

ShellLite is a programming language designed to replace complex shell scripts and Python automation with English-like sentences.

## Philosophy
- **Readable**: Code should read like a story.
- **Concise**: Accomplish tasks in fewer lines.
- **Friendly**: No obscure symbols (`$`, `&&`, `||`) unless necessary.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed.

### Running Code
To run a script:
```bash
shl script.shl
```

To start the interactive REPL:
```bash
shl
```

## Basic Syntax
```javascript
say "Hello World"
i = 10
if i > 5
    say "It is big!"
```
